== Description ==

Business Branding is a robust branding section giving you more options than the standard Pagelines Branding. 

<h3>New in Version 2.0</h3>

<strong>Image and HTML Code Options</strong> Upload an image or enter in your html code for an affiliate banner to display along with your logo/site title.

<strong>More Options for Additional Information</strong> Now you can upload an image to display in this area. You can also use shortcodes - useful for buttons - and some html code in the text.

<h3>Features</h3>

<strong>Display your Logo and Site Title</strong> Choose to display your site title/description with your logo. Or, display just your logo or just your site title.  Your choice.

<strong>Image and HTML Code Options</strong> Now you can put that affiliate banner or image in your branding area. 

<strong>Additional Business Information and Social Icons</strong> Add up to 3 lines of text to display and/or an image with social icons. 


<strong>Color Control</strong> Change the background color of the branding section along with text colors for site title and additional business information.

<strong>Positioning of Elements</strong> Position the site title and additional business information to create an eye-catching branding area.

<strong>Version 2.1 Important Note on Update</strong> This update will affect branding areas that do not display any social icons and rss feed link. This could narrow the spacing between the bottom of the Business Branding Section and next section (possibly your navigation) especially if you already have made a css adjustment to close the spacing. To restore the height remove any adjustment you have made or uncomment the Version 2.1 items in style.less.
